# Deployment Plan

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Krug Champagne Project
- **Project Manager:** Thomas Planchard
- **Start Date:** 2023-05-02
- **End Date:** 2023-06-22


## Deployment Overview

The purpose of this deployment plan is to outline the steps and considerations for the successful deployment of the Krug Champagne Project. The deployment will involve the implementation of the algorithm into the production environment, ensuring a smooth transition from the development phase to the live environment.

## Deployment Goals

- Ensure a seamless transition from the development environment to the production environment.
- Minimize disruption to users during the deployment process.
- Verify the functionality and performance of the Krug Champagne Algorithm in the live environment.
- Provide support and training to end-users for a smooth adoption of the deployed solution.

## Deployment Tasks

1. Pre-Deployment Preparation:
   - Conduct a final review of the system and application requirements for the Krug Champagne Algorithm.
   - Confirm that the software works well for the deployment.
   - Identify any potential issues or risks that may arise during the deployment process.

2. Application Deployment:
   - Prepare the necessary deployment packages and artifacts for the algorithm.
   - Coordinate with the client to schedule a deployment window.
   - Execute the deployment process, following established procedures and guidelines.
   - Monitor the deployment progress and address any issues or errors that may arise.

3. Post-Deployment Verification:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the Krug Champagne Algorithm in the production environment to ensure functionality and performance.
   - Obtain feedback from end-users and stakeholders to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

4. User Training :
   - Provide [documentation](https://github.com/algosup/2022-2023-project-5-algorithmics-Team-7/blob/main/Documents/Software-Documentation.md) to educate end-users on the features and functionalities of the Krug Champagne Algorithm.


5. Deployment Sign-Off:
   - Obtain approval from the project stakeholders and relevant parties for the successful completion of the deployment process.
   - Document and archive the deployment plan, including any changes or lessons learned during the deployment.

## Communication Plan

- Communicate the deployment schedule and expected downtime to all relevant stakeholders, development team, and end-users.
- Provide regular updates and status reports to keep stakeholders informed about the deployment progress.
- Establish Thomas Planchard as the designated point of contact for any deployment-related questions or concerns.

## Contingency Plan

- Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during the deployment process, such as unexpected system errors or compatibility issues.
- Develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans to address these risks, including having a rollback plan in case critical issues occur during the deployment.

## Conclusion

This deployment plan outlines the key tasks and considerations for a successful deployment of the Krug Champagne Project. By following this plan and leveraging effective communication and contingency measures, we aim to ensure a smooth transition to the live environment while minimizing disruptions and providing a reliable and functional solution to our end-users.
