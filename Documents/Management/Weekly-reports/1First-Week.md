<h1>Weekly Report - Week 1</h1>

We are pleased to announce that we have completed the first week of the project. We started the week by discussing to try to understand the project properly and deeply in order to start on a good basis. At this stage, many questions came to mind and one of them was the need for a user interface (UI) in the project. 

As a result, we scheduled a meeting with you to clarify the project's requirements and priorities. This meeting helped us gain a better understanding of the project and its goals, and we were able to revise our approach accordingly. We have now shifted our focus to developing the algorithm, which we believe is the most critical aspect of the project.

Moving forward, we will continue to stay in close communication with you to ensure that we are aligned with the project's goals and requirements. We will also be closely monitoring the project's timeline to ensure that we are on track to deliver the project within the allotted time.
