<h1>Weekly Report - Week 4</h1>

During the fourth week of the project, we encountered some challenges and made progress in various areas. Here's a summary of the key developments:

- **Team Member Unavailability**: Unfortunately, our Tech Lead/Software Engineer faced professional constraints that affected his ability to work on the project. To mitigate this risk, we allocated other team members to continue the development of the software during their absence.

- **New Algorithm Version**: Despite the constraints, the Tech Lead/Software Engineer managed to send a new version of the algorithm by the end of the week. The QA team will focus on testing and reviewing this version in the coming week to provide valuable feedback.

- **Architecture Diagram**: Due to the circumstances, the architecture diagram has not been started yet. This will create a delay in the original project timeline. However, as the same person is responsible for both the software development and technical aspects, he have decided to prioritize completing the software implementation before creating the architecture diagram.

We are actively managing the challenges that arise and adapting our approach to ensure the project progresses smoothly.
