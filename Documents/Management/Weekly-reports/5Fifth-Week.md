<H1>Weekly Report - Week 5</h1>

In the fifth week of the project, significant progress was made on multiple fronts.

- The QA team successfully tested the new version of the algorithm and provided valuable feedback to the development team. This led to the opening of new GitHub issues to address the identified issues and implement necessary improvements.
  
- Regarding the project timeline, we are currently on track and confident that we will be able to deliver the final product on time.
  
- However, we encountered an unexpected challenge as one of our team members, Karine Vinette, the Program Manager, is no longer available due to unforeseen circumstances. In line with our risk management plan, we have distributed her tasks among the remaining team members, Léo Chartier and myself. We are confident that we can efficiently handle Karine’s absence without affecting the project deadline.

Despite this setback, we remain focused and committed to delivering a high-quality solution within the agreed-upon timeframe.
