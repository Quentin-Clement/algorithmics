<h1>Weekly Report 6</h1>

I hope this report finds you well. Here is a summary of our progress and activities for the week:
1. Conception of the Algorithm:
  - Unfortunately, our Software Engineer was unavailable this week, resulting in a delay in the conception of the algorithm.
  - To mitigate the impact on the project timeline, we decided to allocate our resources towards working on the final presentation. This allowed us to make progress on this task and use the time effectively.
2. Final Presentation:
  - We initiated work on the final presentation to ensure that we are ahead in this aspect of the project.
  - The team collaborated to outline the content and structure of the presentation, focusing on delivering a comprehensive and impactful overview of the project.
Overall, while we faced challenges with the unavailability of our Software Engineer and the delay in the algorithm conception, we took proactive measures to utilize our time effectively. By focusing on the final presentation, we were able to make progress in another critical aspect of the project. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work towards mitigating any further impact on the projectâ€™s timeline.
