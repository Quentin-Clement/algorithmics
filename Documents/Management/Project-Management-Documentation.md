## Introduction:

Welcome to the Krug Champagne Project. This project is aimed at building an algorithm that will help in producing the right blend of champagne for our client. Before we proceed, it is important to state the rules and protocols that will guide this project.

## Project Rules:

1. **Communication**: Effective communication is essential for the success of this project. All team members are expected to communicate effectively with each other and respond promptly to messages and emails.

2. **Time Management**: The project duration is 8 weeks, and it is important that we adhere strictly to the schedule. All team members are expected to check regularly the schedule and ensure that they meet their deadlines.

3. **Collaboration**: Collaboration is key to the success of this project. All team members are expected to work together. If you need help, please reach out to your team members.

4. **Quality Assurance**: The QA process is a critical part of our project to ensure that our product meets the required standards and quality. To achieve this, we will set up an automatic email that will be sent to the development team each time a test fails, notifying them of which task they need to prioritize. The QA process is defined in detail in the [Quality assurance plan]().


## Project Protocols:

1. **KPIs**: The project's key performance indicators will be measured at specific intervals. All team members are expected to fill their KPIs promptly and accurately. Team members are expected to fill their KPIs at the end of each week. <br>Here is the link to [KPIs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rdj3Sp6lbA9zX_4oCAbLPIQLKgYrU9wKa_OI0TgnUcU/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Task Management**: All team members will have access to the project management tool ([Trello]()) to manage their tasks and track their progress. Every Sunday, an email will be sent to every team member with a recap of all the tasks to do, pending, and completed. This email will serve as a reminder of the project's progress and will allow team members to plan their upcoming week. 

3. **RACI Matrix**: The [RACI matrix](RACI.pdf) will be used to define team roles and responsibilities. All team members are expected to familiarize themselves with the matrix and adhere to their assigned roles.

4. **Project Schedule**: The project schedule will be updated regularly to reflect the current status of the project. All team members are expected to check the schedule regularly and ensure that they meet their deadlines. Here is the link to the [project schedule](https://trello.com/b/QVQdK1at/finalproject/calendar/2023/05).

5. **Risk management**: [The Risk Management Plan](Risk-Management-Plan.md) is a critical component of the project management plan. By identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate these risks, the project team can increase the likelihood of project success. The risk management plan will be reviewed each week and updated throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that risks are effectively managed.
   

## Critical Path: 
Each week, the team will discuss the progress made on the critical path tasks and identify any potential roadblocks that may delay the project's completion. This will allow the team to make informed decisions and prioritize tasks to ensure that the project stays on track.

To update the critical path, we will hold a meeting at the start of each week to discuss any changes or updates that need to be made. The project manager will update the critical path document and distribute it to the team so that everyone is aware of any changes. 
 
It is important to note that any delays or issues with critical path tasks must be communicated to the project manager immediately so that appropriate action can be taken to minimize the impact on the project's timeline.

The critical path is available in the Management folder in the Documents folder, which also includes other important documents related to the project, such as the risk management plan, RACI matrix, weekly reports... It is essential that all team members are familiar with the critical path and refer to it regularly to ensure that the project stays on track.


## Conclusion:
By adhering to these rules and protocols, we can ensure a successful project outcome. Let's work together to achieve the project.
