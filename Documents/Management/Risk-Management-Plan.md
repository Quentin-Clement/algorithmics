## Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to identify and address potential risks that may impact the successful development and implementation of the Krug Champagne Project.

## Objectives

The objectives of this Risk Management Plan are to:

- Identify potential risks that may impact the project
- Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each risk
- Develop strategies to mitigate each risk
- Monitor and update the risk management plan throughout the project lifecycle



## Risk Assessment

Each identified risk will be assessed based on its likelihood of occurring and its potential impact on the project. The following criteria will be used to assess risks:

- Likelihood: High, Medium, or Low
- Impact: High, Medium, or Low

The risk matrix will be used to determine the level of risk associated with each identified risk.


## Risk Identification

| Risk | Impact indicator | Impact on Project | Solution | Likelihood | 
|----------|-------|------------------|----------|----- | 
| Key team member leaves the project | High | Delayed project delivery, knowledge loss | Document knowledge and share with team, assign replacement team member | Low| 
| Inadequate project planning | Medium | Confusion, scope creep, missed deadlines | Develop and follow a detailed project plan, involve all stakeholders in planning and review regularly |Low | 
| Technical difficulties | Medium | Delayed project delivery, increased development time | Conduct thorough technical analysis, allocate additional resources or consider alternative solutions |Medium | 
| Inadequate testing | High | This risk can lead to errors, bugs, and poor quality | The QA team will implement a comprehensive testing plan that includes functional, performance, and user acceptance testing. The testing plan will be developed in collaboration with the development team and reviewed regularly to ensure that all necessary tests are being conducted. |Medium | 
| Communication breakdown | High | Misunderstandings, missed deadlines | Establish clear communication channels, hold regular project status meetings, document and distribute meeting minutes |Low | 
| Scope creep | High | Increased development time, increased costs | Establish clear project scope and deliverables, manage stakeholder expectations, regularly review and adjust project scope as needed | Low | 
| Changes in stakeholder requirements | Medium | This risk can cause delays and may impact the quality of work | The project and program manager will communicate with stakeholders regularly to ensure that their requirements are being met. Any changes to requirements will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor before being implemented. In addition, the project manager will track progress against the project schedule to identify any potential impacts of changing requirements. | Medium | 
| Illness or unavailability of team members | Medium | Delayed project delivery, knowledge loss | Cross-train team members, establish clear roles and responsibilities, consider additional resources or temporary staff |Medium | 
| Technical compatibility issues | Medium | System conflicts, limited functionality | Conduct thorough compatibility testing, collaborate with relevant technology providers, consider alternative solutions | Medium |
| Inadequate quality assurance | High | Software bugs and errors, poor user experience | Implement a comprehensive QA process, conduct functional and user acceptance testing, prioritize bug fixes and enhancements | Medium |
|Inaccurate champagne formula input | High | Incorrect blending ratios, compromised champagne quality | Develop a robust data verification process, implement automated checks for formula accuracy, verify if the formula is reaching 100% in value | Medium |
| Incorrect conversion of formulas | High | Incorrect units, measurement errors | Implement standardized conversion processes, provide clear instructions for converting formulas, double-check converted values | Low |
| Inaccurate quantity remaining in tanks | High | Oxydation of a large quantity of wine leading to a lost of money | Check regularly the accuracy of the algorithm with the wine remaining in the tanks | Medium |



## Risk Monitoring and Control

The project manager will monitor and control risks throughout the project lifecycle. The following activities will be performed:

- Regularly review and update the risk register
- Assess new risks as they arise
- Implement risk mitigation strategies
- Monitor the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies
- Communicate any changes to the risk management plan to the project team and stakeholders

## Communication Plan

The project manager will communicate the risk management plan to the project team and stakeholders. The following communication plan will be used:

- The risk management plan will be included in the project management plan, which will be shared with the project team and stakeholders
- Regular project status reports will include updates on the risk management plan and any changes to the risk register
- The project manager will communicate any changes to the risk management plan to the project team and stakeholders in a timely manner
