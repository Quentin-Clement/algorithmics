# Project Status Report

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Krug Champagne Project
- **Project Manager:** Thomas Planchard
- **Start Date:** 2023-05-02
- **End Date:** 2023-06-22


## Project Summary

This project status report provides an overview of the progress and achievements during Phase 3 of the Krug Champagne Project. The report highlights the accomplishments, challenges, and upcoming tasks for the reporting period.

## Accomplishments 

- Conducted systematic testing of the algorithm to ensure correctness and accuracy.
- Addressed identified issues and refined the algorithm based on testing results.
- Documented the testing process and results in a comprehensive report.


## Upcoming Tasks

- Review and validate the testing report.
- Incorporate any necessary changes based on the testing feedback.
- Finalize the algorithm documentation.
- Prepare for the final presentation and demonstration of the algorithm.

## Issues and Concerns

- We faced a challenge during week 6 as one our software engineers was unavailable, which resulted in a delay in the algorithm's development. However, the team adapted by working on other project aspects, such as documentation and presentation preparation, to utilize the time effectively.


## Risks and Mitigation

- Risk 1: Potential accuracy issues in the algorithm results.
  - Mitigation: Implemented rigorous testing and incorporated feedback from stakeholders to ensure accuracy and reliability.


## Project Metrics

- Percentage of tasks completed: 70%
- Project timeline: On track


## Conclusion

In phase 3, significant progress has been made in testing and refining the algorithm. The team successfully addressed identified issues and documented the testing process and results. With the finalization of the algorithm documentation and preparation for the final presentation, we are on track to deliver a high-quality solution that meets the project goals within the agreed timeline.



## Next Report
