# Project Status Report

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Krug Champagne Project
- **Project Manager:** Thomas Planchard
- **Start Date:** 2023-05-02
- **End Date:** 2023-06-22

## Project Summary
This project status report provides an overview of the progress and achievements during Phase 2 of the Krug Champagne Project. The report highlights the accomplishments, challenges, and upcoming tasks for the reporting period.

## Accomplishments
- Developed the initial version of the algorithm for blending champagne.
- Completed the technical specifications document.
- Conducted initial testing and validation of the algorithm.
- Updated the project schedule to include Phase 2 tasks and milestones.

## Work Completed
- Developed the algorithm logic and implemented the core blending functionalities.
- Conducted unit testing to ensure the algorithm functions as expected.
- Documented the test results and identified areas for improvement.
- Technical specification written.


## Issues and Challenges
- One of our team members was unavailable for a week due to professional reasons, impacting the development progress.
- The absence of our team member resulted in a temporary delay in the execution of development tasks and coordination within the team.


## Risk Assessment
- **Team member unavailability:** The absence of a team member for a week due to professional reasons has temporarily impacted the development progress and coordination within the team. To mitigate this, we have redistributed the workload among the remaining team members and adjusted the project schedule to minimize the impact on the overall timeline.
- **Team member departure:** The departure of a team member from the project can disrupt the team dynamics and impact the distribution of tasks and responsibilities. It may also result in a knowledge gap and delay in project progress. To mitigate this risk, we will document and share knowledge among team members, conduct a thorough handover process, and consider resource allocation adjustments to ensure continuity and minimize the impact on project deliverables.

## Resources
- Resource allocation remains stable, with team members dedicated to their respective tasks.

## Upcoming Tasks and Milestones
- Conduct extensive testing and validation of the algorithm using real-world data.
- Refine and optimize the algorithm based on the test results.
- Collaborate with the QA team to address their feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## Project Metrics
- Percentage of tasks completed: 40%
- Project timeline: On track


## Conclusion
Phase 2 of the Krug Champagne Project has seen significant progress in the development and integration of the algorithm. Despite challenges related to the unavailability of one team member and the departure of another, the team remains focused on refining the algorithm and meeting the project objectives. The upcoming tasks and milestones will further advance the project towards its successful completion.
