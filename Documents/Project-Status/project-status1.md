# Project Status Report - Phase 1

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Krug Champagne Project
- **Project Manager:** Thomas Planchard
- **Start Date:** 2023-05-02
- **End Date:** 2023-06-22

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to create an algorithm for the Krug Champagne producer to optimize the blending process of their champagne while minimizing wine waste and maximizing their gains. Phase 1 of the project involves gathering information and requirements from stakeholders, researching existing algorithms, and designing the initial framework of the algorithm.

## Accomplishments 
- Conducted meetings with stakeholders to gather information and requirements
- Researched existing algorithms 
- Designed the initial framework of the algorithm
- Discussed potential challenges and risks with the team and created a risk management plan

## Upcoming Tasks
- Finalize the algorithm design
- Begin coding the algorithm 
- Test the algorithm on a small dataset to ensure accuracy
- Continue communicating with stakeholders to ensure project goals and requirements are met

## Issues and Concerns
- We initially considered incorporating a user interface into the algorithm, but after further discussion with the project sponsor, we determined that it was not necessary and would delay the project timeline.


## Project Metrics
- Percentage of tasks completed: 20%
- Project timeline: On track
- Budget: N/A

## Next Report
The next report will be submitted on 2023-06-02, covering the progress made during Phase 2 of the project.
