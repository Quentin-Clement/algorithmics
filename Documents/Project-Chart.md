The project benefits include:

- Improved efficiency: The algorithm will streamline the champagne-making process, reducing waste and increasing productivity.

- Consistency in quality: With the algorithm, the champagne produced will have a consistent taste and quality, meeting the high standards of Krug champagne.

- Cost reduction: By optimizing the process, the algorithm will help reduce costs associated with production.

- Increased revenue: The improved efficiency and consistent quality of the champagne will help increase sales and revenue for Krug champagne.

- Competitive advantage: With the algorithm, Krug champagne will have a unique selling point that sets it apart from its competitors, giving it a competitive advantage in the market.

## User Roles

This application is used by 2 types of users.

1. **Industrial User** - They will use the algorithm to optimize the production process and minimize waste of wine, in order to maximize profits.
2. **Sommeliers** - They will use the algorithm to ensure the right blend of wines to achieve the desired taste and quality for the Krug Champagne.

Note: The producer is particularly concerned with minimizing waste of wine during the production process, as this can impact the overall profitability of the project.

Finally, the champagne producer will be provided with the final version of the algorithm, along with any necessary documentation and support, and will be instructed on how to use it effectively to ensure that the champagne is of the highest possible quality while minimizing wine waste and maximizing gains.

## Out of scope

- Integration with any external software or hardware systems.
- Providing training to end-users on how to operate the physical equipment used for champagne production.
- Providing any legal or financial advice related to the production or distribution of champagne.
- Providing any support or maintenance services beyond the initial delivery of the software.
- Create a user interface or anything related to a visual interface.

## Schedule

The team has decided to centralize all project information on Trello. Due to the limitations of free versions of software like Jira or Gantt chart, Trello was determined to be the best choice.

The complete schedule is shown in the following calendar:
- [Trello calendar](https://trello.com/b/QVQdK1at/finalproject/calendar/2023/05)


Note: There should be some overlap between phases, especially between phase 2 and phase 3, to ensure timely delivery of the software. Additionally, there should be buffer time built into the schedule to accommodate any unexpected delays or issues that may arise.

## Budget


Since this project is provided by the school, there is no allocated budget apart from the time and resources that the team members are willing to dedicate to it. Therefore, the budget for this project remains unchanged. The team will need to utilize existing resources and tools to complete the project within the given timeframe.

## Risk

The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule:


1. Technical risks: There may be technical challenges while developing the algorithm that meets the quality standards of the Krug champagne producer. This could lead to project delays and additional costs.

2. Resource risks: If any team member leaves the project before completion, it can affect the project timeline and deliverables. The team must have a contingency plan to mitigate the impact of such risks.


3. Compliance risks: The project must comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to the champagne production process. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to legal and financial penalties.

To mitigate these risks, the team will conduct regular risk assessments throughout the project lifecycle. The team will also implement appropriate risk management strategies, such as contingency planning, quality control processes, and regular project status updates to stakeholders.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The software should be able to receive input values for tanks numbers and volumes, formula, the quantity of each wine and use them to calculate the minimum number of steps to be as close as possible to the original formula.

2. The software should be able to validate the input values, ensuring they are within reasonable ranges and that the total blend percentage adds up to 100%.

3. The software should be able to generate a report of the recommended blend percentages for each tank based on the input values.

4. The software should be able to display an error message if any input value is missing or invalid, and prompt the user to correct the error.
