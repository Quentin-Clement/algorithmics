# Krug Champagne Project

This software has been designed for Krug Champagne, which is a part of LVMH. The software aims to assist in the blending stage of the champagne-making process. The blending stage is a critical phase in creating the Champagne.

## Background
Champagne is a sparkling wine made using the traditional method, also known as the méthode champenoise. The method involves a complex process of fermentation and aging to create a unique flavor and texture that is associated with champagne. The main steps involved in making champagne are harvesting, pressing, first fermentation, blending, second fermentation, aging, riddling, disgorgement, and dosage.

The software focuses on stage 4: blending.  As example, Krug Grande cuvée is a combination of 250 wines of the year plus 150 “reserve” wines from the past 14 years. The Cellar Master, and her team will taste different combinations for about 9 months until they find the perfect formula (a bit like a perfume). Once the formula is known, it becomes the challenge of blending large quantities of wine in the right proportions.

## Features
The software has the following features:

Tank Management: The software manages  tanks of various sizes that can be reused several times in the blending process. The system ensures that the tanks are never left partially full or empty to prevent oxidation and to ensure that the wine is never in contact with oxygen.

Formula Matching: The software matches the input formula provided by the user and her team as closely as possible.

Blending Optimization: The software optimizes the blending process to use the minimum number of steps to achieve the desired result.

Speed: The software is designed to be fast, ensuring that the blending process is efficient and the champagne is produced as quickly as possible.

Evaluation Criteria
The software will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness: The software must not crash, and there should be no half-full or half-empty tanks during the blending process.

Formula Matching: The software should produce a champagne blend that is as close as possible to the input formula provided by Julie CAVIL and her team.

Minimum Number of Steps: The software should use the minimum number of steps to achieve the desired blending result.

## Conclusion
This software has been designed to assist Krug Champagne in the blending stage of the champagne-making process. The software optimizes the blending process to produce a champagne blend that matches the input formula as closely as possible while using the minimum number of steps. The software manages tanks of various sizes and ensures that they are never left partially full or empty, preventing oxidation and ensuring that the wine is never in contact with oxygen. The software will be evaluated based on its correctness, formula matching, minimum number of steps, and speed.
